# Resume2020
Portfolio repository to complement my resume.

Any work shown here can be used to help anyone in their work :)

Please note that many sensitive data have been zero'ed out. Also, references to my company's software artifacts and core business have been removed.

Hence the projects here cannot execute properly without modifications.

Thanks for having a look and for your kind understanding.
