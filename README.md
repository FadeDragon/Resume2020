# Resume2020
Portfolio repository to complement my resume.

Any work shown here can be used to help anyone in their work :)

Please note that sensitive data have been zero'ed out, and references to my company's software artifacts + core business logic have been removed.

Hence the projects here cannot execute properly without some changes.

Thanks for having a look and for your kind understanding.
