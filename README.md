# Resume2021
Portfolio repository to complement my resume.

Thanks for having a look.

Although the stuff here is really basic, any work shown here can be used to help anyone if they found it useful :)

Please note that sensitive data have been zero'ed out, and references to my company's software artifacts + core business logic have been removed.

Hence the projects here cannot execute properly without some changes. Please understand.
